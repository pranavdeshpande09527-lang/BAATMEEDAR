1. Rate Limiting
Add rate limiting appropriate to each endpoint type: stricter limits
on authentication routes (e.g. login, signup, password reset),
moderate limits on public endpoints, and looser limits on
authenticated user actions.
For auth routes, use a combination of per-IP and per-account limits
with exponential backoff rather than a hard lockout.
Make all thresholds configurable, not hardcoded.

2. Input Validation
Validate every input against a strict schema (type, length, format)
and reject anything that doesn't match - don't just
sanitize/escape.

3. Secrets
Scan the complete codebase for any hardcoded API keys, tokens, or
passwords. Use environment variables and verify that nothing
sensitive is shipped into the frontend or pushed to git.

4. Dependency Vulnerabilities
Run a dependency audit across the project. Identify any packages with
known vulnerabilities, list their severity, and update or replace
them where safe to do so.

5. Error Handling & Information Leakage
Review all error handling across the app. Ensure users never see
stack traces, internal file paths, or raw database errors - return
generic messages instead, while still logging full error details
server-side for debugging.

6. File Upload Safety
Review any file upload functionality. Confirm file type, size, and
content are validated (not just the extension), uploads are stored
outside the web root or in isolated storage, and uploaded files can
never be executed as code.
